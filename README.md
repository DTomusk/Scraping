# Scraping
Spiders that scrape data from IMDb. The main spider of interest is in expanding_spider.py and can be used to generate plots as in the example from individually scraping films and actors. 

Project is currently on hold as I explore different aspects of programming and different languages, I feel I've gained a good understanding of webscraping, html parsing, regular expressions, networkx, and plotly (the latter two of which I'd like to explore more in depth).
