# Scraping
Various experiments using scrapy and data from IMDb. The main goal is to create an interactive graph that plots the connections between actors and films chosen by the user. Also makes use of networkx, matplotlib and plotly. The current main spider of interest is "grow" in expanding_spider.py (never been the best at naming things).
